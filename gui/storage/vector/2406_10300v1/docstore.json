Developing a taxonomy involves cre-\nating a representation that effectively supports its\nintended purpose [29]. Taxonomies can be repre-\nsented in various formats, with morphological boxes\n[54, 55] or radar charts [21] being well-established\napproaches. We evaluated morphological boxes, be-\ncause they effectively position categorized instances\nwithinthedesignspace. However, wefoundthatthey\nmake it difficult to perceive a group of categorized in-\nstances as a whole since they occupy a large display\narea. This drawback is significant for our purposes,\nas LLM-integrated applications often comprise mul-\ntiple LLM components. Therefore, we developed a\nmore condensed visualization of the taxonomy based\non feature vectors.\nExample instances.

The presentation layer\nimplements the UI. On the input side, it allows users\nto enter data and commands that control the appli-\ncation.

The data layer of an application\nmanages the reading and writing of data from and\nto persistent data storage. Due to its versatility, an\nLLM component can simultaneously implement func-\ntionality for all three layers.

Table 4 gives an\noverview of the LLMs used in our sample of appli-\ncations. Where papers report evaluations of mul-\ntiple LLMs, the table displays the chosen or best-\nperforming LLM. Although not representative, the\ntable provides some insights. LMaaS dominates,\nlikely due to its convenience, but more importantly,\ndue to the superior performance of the provided\nLLMs.\nConcerns regarding LMaaS include privacy, as sensi-\ntive data might be transmitted to the LLM through\nthe prompt [64], and service quality, i.e., reliability,\navailability, and costs. Costs typically depend on the\nquantity of processed tokens. This quantity also af-\nfects latency, which denotes the processing time of\nan LLM invocation. A further important factor for\nlatency is the size of the LLM, with larger models\nbeing slower [7].\nWhen building LLM-based applications for real-\nworlduse, thereliabilityandavailabilityofanLMaaS\nare crucial. Availability depends not only on the\ntechnical stability of the service, but also on factors\nsuch as increased latency during high usage periods\nor usage restrictions imposed by the provider of an\nLMaaS, as reported for ProgPrompt [51]. Beyond\ntechnical aspects, the reliability of an LMaaS also en-\ncompassesitsbehavior.

for LLM-Integrated Applications", "Authors": "Irene Weber", "Date published": "06/13/2024", "URL": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10300v1", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely adopted recently. Research\nexplores their use both as autonomous agents and as tools for software\nengineering. LLM-integrated applications, on the other hand, are software\nsystems that leverage an LLM to perform tasks that would otherwise be\nimpossible or require significant coding effort. While LLM-integrated\napplication engineering is emerging as new discipline, its terminology,\nconcepts and methods need to be established. This study provides a taxonomy for\nLLM-integrated applications, offering a framework for analyzing and describing\nthese systems. It also demonstrates various ways to utilize LLMs in\napplications, as well as options for implementing such integrations.\n  Following established methods, we analyze a sample of recent LLM-integrated\napplications to identify relevant dimensions. We evaluate the taxonomy by\napplying it to additional cases. This review shows that applications integrate\nLLMs in numerous ways for various purposes. Frequently, they comprise multiple\nLLM integrations, which we term ``LLM components''. To gain a clear\nunderstanding of an application's architecture, we examine each LLM component\nseparately. We identify thirteen dimensions along which to characterize an LLM\ncomponent, including the LLM skills leveraged, the format of the output, and\nmore. LLM-integrated applications are described as combinations of their LLM\ncomponents. We suggest a concise representation using feature vectors for\nvisualization.\n  The taxonomy is effective for describing LLM-integrated applications. It can\ncontribute to theory building in the nascent field of LLM-integrated\napplication engineering and aid in developing such systems.
