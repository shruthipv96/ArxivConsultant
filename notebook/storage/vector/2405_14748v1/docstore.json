I NTRODUCTION\nA time series is a sequence of data points, typically recorded\nat successive equally spaced intervals of time. These data\npoints can represent various measurements, observations, or\nreadings taken over time, such as temperature readings, stock\nprices, sales figures, or sensor readings. Time series analysis\ninvolves studying the patterns, trends, and relationships present\nin the data to understand its behavior over time [1]. Time series\nforecasting predicts future values of a time series based on its\npast observations.\nTraditional time series forecasting methods have demon-\nstrated considerable efficacy over the years and continue to\nmaintain relevance and widespread adoption in contemporary\npractice [2]. In general, these methods can be categorized into\nlinear [3], [4] and non-linear models [5], [6].\nArguably, the most popular traditional time series method\nis AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [7].\nARIMA consists of three independent components; (i) the\nAutoRegressive (AR) component assumes that the current\nvalue of a time series is a linear combination of its past\nvalues, with the addition of a white-noise term; (ii) the Moving\nAverage (MA) component assumes that the current value of a\ntime series variable is a linear combination of past white-noise\nterms, with no dependence on past values of the variable itself;\n(iii) the integrated (I) component incorporates differencing to\nmake the time series stationary, allowing for the modeling of\nnonstationary time series data.\nMachine learning and, in particular, deep learning has\nemerged as a transformative approach in the field of timeseries forecasting, offering new advances [8]\u2013[11]. Moreover,\npre-training has been used in deep learning, to significantly\naccelerate the training process and increase performance [12].\nIn domains such as computer vision and Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), pre-training facilitates scaling of perfor-\nmance with the availability of data. However, in the context\nof time series modeling, access to sizable pretraining datasets\nis often limited.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a popular\ntool for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, and have\nreceived considerable attention in recent years.

LLMs are\npretrained models, trained on vast amounts of text data. Their\nability to learn rich representations of language has drawn the\nattention of the scientific community over the past few years.\nSpecifically, LLMs are quite capable of capturing syntactic,\nsemantic, and contextual information [13]. Another interesting\naspect of LLMs are emergent abilities [14], which are capabil-\nities that are not explicitly programmed or designed, but rather\nspontaneously emerge from the complex internal processes of\nthe models.

R ELATED WORK\nLLMs have been applied into many different domains and\ncontexts such as healthcare [18], [19], [20], financial modeling\n[21], [22], [23], and education and research [24], [25], as\nwell as in time series data [26] for many different tasks and\napplication domains [27].\nThe authors of TIME-LLM [28], introduce a reprogramming\nframework aimed at adapting LLMs for time series forecasting\nwithout altering their pre-trained structure. TIME-LLM re-\nprograms input time series into text prototype representations\nthat suit LLMs\u2019 capabilities. By introducing Prompt-as-Prefix\n(PaP), which enriches the input context with natural language\ninstructions, the reprogrammed input is then processed by the\nfrozen LLM. The output is projected to generate time series\nforecasts updating only lightweight input transformation and\noutput projection parameters, while the backbone language\nmodel remains frozen. Scenarios for both short- and long-term\nare addressed, as well as few- and one-shot learning.\nLLMTIME [15] is the first approach to apply zero-shot\nforecasting on time series using LLMs. The authors argue that\nthe output of LLMs when predicting digit-by-digit follows\na multimodal distribution, which fits well in the case of\ntime series. To apply forecasting, the time series values are\ntokenized and rescaled to a predefined number of digits to use\nfewer tokens. Then, to apply forecasting, the time series with\ntheir tokenized values separated by commas are passed to the\nmodel. Notably, the model\u2019s output is limited to producing\nonly digits and commas (i.e., [0\u22129,]). At each time step, a\npredefined number of samples is drawn and the final forecast\nis built using the median of all samples after descaling the\noutputted values.\nDespite the potential of LLMs for time series forecasting,\nthere are several limitations that need to be addressed.\n\u2022No multivariate support : Most current approaches using\nLLMs for time series forecasting focus on univariate time\nseries data. This limitation restricts the applicability of\nLLMs to certain types of time series data.\n\u2022Fine-tuning requirement : Fine-tuning can be time-\nconsuming and computationally expensive, particularly\nfor large models. It also requires a substantial amount\nof training data, which may not always be available.\n\u2022Number of tokens required : LLMs are extremely large\nmodels, capable of efficiently running on computers\nequipped with GPUs of high capacity in RAM. Thus,\ntheir broad availability depends on services that host\nsuch models, which usually charge queries by token.\nConsequently, very large queries (e.g., a large time series\nin our context) would be rather expensive to run.\nIII.

Quantization Using SAX\nThe Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) is a multi-\nresolution representation of a time series introduced in [29]. It\ncan be derived from its Piecewise Aggregate Approximation(PAA) [30], [31] by quantizing the PAA segments on the\nv-axis. A time series is first transformed into a PAA rep-\nresentation of wsegments with real-valued coefficients. To\nobtain a SAX word for a time series, these coefficients are\ndiscretized along the value axis using breakpoints assuming\naN(0,1)Gaussian distribution that enables the generation\nof equiprobable symbols for a given cardinality. Although\nbitwise representations were used for these symbols in the\noriginal paper, other encoding types are also possible. Two\nsuch popular alternatives are using alphabetical characters or\ndigits for each symbol.\nForecasting time series is an inherently difficult task due\nto the nature of the data. This is also the case for zero-shot\nforeasting using LLMs, since (i.e., as also described in [15])\nthey have to infer a sequence of tokens for each timestamp,\nthus simulating a multi-modal distribution. This becomes even\nharder when applying the above-mentioned dimensional multi-\nplexing techniques. Also, for large time series, such a process\nbecomes significantly more computationally intensive; plus, it\nrequires many tokens, which, depending on the application,\ncan be rather expensive to infer according to currently LLM\npricing policies. To alleviate these issues, we quantize the\ntime series across all dimensions in both axes using the SAX\nrepresentation, before applying tokenization. We support two\ndifferent quantization types, either using an alphabetical or\na digital SAX alphabet. Now, each value per timestamp is\nconsisted of only one token instead of multiple. For example,\nthe time series in Figure 1 could become dsax\n1= [a, b, ... ]and\ndsax\n2= [b, c, ... ]after alphabetical quantization. We expect that\nit will be easier for the model to detect patterns when dealing\nonly with one token per timestamp.\nIV.

In the following, we evaluate its\naccuracy using LLaMA2 (i.e., the 7B parameter variant) and\nPhi-2 [36] as back-end models.

Table III lists the\nforecast RMSE for the Gas Rate data set in both dimensions\nfor both LLMs. In both cases, the VI variant of MultiCast\nwas used. LLaMA2 achieves better performance (i.e., approx.\ntwice as good) in all cases. This can be attributed to the\nfewer parameters of the Phi-2 model; while it is math-oriented\nand quite capable of solving complex problems described by\ntextual prompting, it seems to not properly detect the patterns\nin the series, leading to larger errors.\nTABLE III\nLLM MODEL COMPARISON .\nModelDimension\nGasRate CO2\nMultiCast (LLaMA2 / 7B) 1.154 2.71\nMultiCast (Phi-2 / 2.7B) 2.106 4.676\nFigures 2a and b depict two indicative examples of fore-\ncasting the first dimension of the Gas Rate dataset using\nthe LLaMA2 and Phi-2 models, respectively.

Phi-2, on the other hand,\nfails to accurately forecast the time series in this dimension;\nwhile it seems to successfully detect the upward trend, its\nentire output is shifted 1 to 2 units on the y-axis.

For\nthe HULL dimension, all approaches seem to produce good\nresults, with LLMTIME achieving the best RMSE. Finally, for\nthe OT dimension, ARIMA performs significantly better than\nthe competition. The MultiCast approaches do not perform\nwell. LLMTIME is the best among LLM-based models. This\nsuggests a possible drop in the performance of MultiCast as\nthe dimensionality of the time series increases since there is\nthe extra step of demultiplexing the input that the LLMs must\ninfer. However, the error in the best LLM-based model (9.198)\nis very close to that of the LSTM model (8.740).\nFigure 4 illustrates an indicative example of the MultiCast\n(VC) forecast output (Figure 4a) against the LSTM (Figure 4b)\nfor the HUFL dimension of the electricity data set.

This\ncould suggest that it may be easier for the LLMs to detect\npatterns in time series represented by numbers rather than\nalphabetical characters.2) Increasing SAX Alphabet Size: In the following, we\nevaluate the performance of MultiCast, in terms of RMSE\nand execution time, when increasing the size of the SAX\nalphabet. Table IX lists the results. We should note that for\ndigits we can only go up to an alphabet of size 10. Again, the\nnon-quantized MultiCast yields better performance in terms of\nRMSE, but is significantly slower. Increasing the size of the\nalphabet does not seem to affect the execution time. Also, in\nterms of RMSE, larger alphabet sizes produced higher errors,\npossibly due to the increase in complexity that the use of more\nsymbols induces.\nTABLE IX\nINCREASING SAX ALPHABET SIZE .\nMethodSAX Alphabet Size\n5 10 20\nMultiCast SAX (alphabetical)0.983\n77 sec1.198\n81 sec1.273\n83 sec\nMultiCast SAX (digital)0.99\n71 sec1.21\n75 secN/A\nMultiCast0.781\n1168 sec\nFinally, Figure 7 shows an indicative forecasting example\nfor 5, 10 and 20 SAX symbols for the CO2 %dimension of the\nGas Rate dataset.

C ONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we presented MultiCast, an approach that\nleverages LLMs for zero-shot multivariate time series fore-\ncasting. To make this model work with multiple dimensions,\nwe proposed three token multiplexing solutions that reduce\nthe dimensionality of the time series to one. This allows\nthe time series to be compatible with the input of an LLM,\nwhile still preserving its ability to detect repetitive patterns.\nAdditionally, we presented a quantization solution that aims\nto facilitate the learning of existing patterns in the series by\nLLMs. This solution also significantly reduces the execution\ntime. In our comprehensive experimental analysis using three\nreal-world datasets, we found that the use of LLMs for\nmultivariate zero-shot time series forecasting shows promise\nand offers a significant advantage compared to other similar\nmethods available in the literature: No expert knowledge or\ntime and resource-consuming parameter search processes are\nrequired . In the future, we plan to expand our research on\nemploying LLMs for zero-shot solutions on other similar time\nseries-related tasks, such as imputation, anomaly detection,\nand change point detection, as well as evaluate MultiCast\u2019s\ninference performance using more LLMs as back-end models\nand further improving it in more dimensions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was partially funded by the EU Horizon Europe\nprojects STELAR (101070122) and DT4GS (101056799).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3014, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69fd0612-613f-4ccf-a290-f31496420098": {"__data__": {"id_": "69fd0612-613f-4ccf-a290-f31496420098", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "2405_14748v1.pdf", "Title of this paper": "MultiCast: Zero-Shot Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Using LLMs", "Authors": "Georgios Chatzigeorgakidis, Konstantinos Lentzos, Dimitrios Skoutas", "Date published": "05/23/2024", "URL": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14748v1", "summary": "Predicting future values in multivariate time series is vital across various\ndomains.
