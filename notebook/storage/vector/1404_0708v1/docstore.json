Introduction  \nFor any design an d modelling purpose,  the ultimate aim is to gain sufficient insight into the system of interest so \nas to provide more accurate predictions and better designs. Therefore, computational optimization, model ling and \nsimulation forms an integrated part of the m odern design practice in engineering and industry. As resources are \nlimited, to minimize the cost and energy consumption, and to maximize the performance, profits and efficiency can \nbe crucially important in all designs [1 -6]. The stringent requirement s of minimizing environmental impact and \ncarbon footprint require a paradigm shift in scientific thinking and design practice. However, real -world problems \nare usually far more complex than models can capture and far more nonlinear than optimization tools can handle ; \nconsequently, approximations are necessity as well as a practical possibility.  \n Most  design optimization typically involves uncertainty in material properties and parameters. In this case, \noptimal design does not necessarily mean robust. In fact, w e often have to settle for the robust, suboptimal design \noptions. After all, we wish to solve our design and model ling problems with sufficient ly good accuracy assuming \nreasonable time expenditures  [1,5] . \n     Despite  the significant progress made in the l ast few decades, many challenging issues still remain unresolved. \nChallenges may be related to various aspects and depend on many intertwine d factors. In the current context, such \nchallenges are related to nonlinearity, scale of t he problem, time constrain t and the complexity of the system. First, \nmany problems are highly nonlinear, and thus their obje ctive landscapes are multimodal. Consequently, multiple \noptima may be present . Many traditional algorithms do not cope well with such high multimodality. This \nnecessitates new techniques to be developed. Second, many real -world problems may be very large -scale, though \nmost optimization methods are tested over small -scale problems.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3645, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "583347a6-f979-456c-b36a-9b8283cfb1bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "583347a6-f979-456c-b36a-9b8283cfb1bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "1404_0708v1.pdf", "Title of this paper": "Computational Optimization, Modelling and Simulation: Recent Trends and Challenges", "Authors": "Xin-She Yang, Slawomir Koziel, Leifur Leifsson", "Date published": "04/02/2014", "URL": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0708v1", "summary": "Modelling, simulation and optimization form an integrated part of modern\ndesign practice in engineering and industry.

We will also \nbriefly introduce the topics and papers in this workshop.  \n2. Trends and Challenges in Computational Optimization  \nFor proper  formulation of optimization  problems, the desi gn objectives and behaviors of a  system have to be re -\nformulated in mathematical terms to define an objective function (or functions) so that the formal relationship \nbetween the values of the designable paramete rs and the system performance can be  establis hed. In some cases, this \nrelationship can be represented in a form of a scalar function that can be mini mized, while  in many other cases, a set \nof competing objectives can be only formulated, leading to a complex, multi -objective optimization problem. Even  \nif the solution sets to a multi -objective problem can be found, it can result in a decision -making process to select the \nbest combination out of  a feasible  set of, usually non -commensurable, objective sets.  Such selection is not trivial, \ndepending on the utility and/or decision criteria.  \nThe recent trends in computational optimization move away from the traditional methods to contemporary \nnature -inspired metaheuristic algorithms  [2,7,8], though traditional methods can still be an important part of  the \nsolution techniques. However, new studies and research tend to focus on the development of novel techniques that \nprimarily based on swarm intelligence. New algorithms such as particle swarm optimization, cuckoo search and \nfirefly algorithm have become hugely popular. One of the reasons for such popularity is that these metaheuristic \nalgorithms are simple and easy to implement, and yet they can solve very diverse, often highly nonlinear problems. \nThis partly meets the need to deal with nonlinearity in a non -conventional way.  \nMultimodality in many design problems mean the true global optimality is not easy to reach. In fact, there is no \nguarantee if the global optimality can be reached in a finite number of iterations. However, there is sufficient \nevidence that the global optimum can be found using nature -inspired algorithms in a vast majority of the cases. \nThere are many reasons for good success rates in searching for optimality, a main reason is that metaheuristic \nalgorithms use stochastic component s or randomiz ation techniques to increase the ergodicity of the iterative search \npath.  \nNature -inspired algorithms have the advantages of simplicity, flexibility, and ergodicity  [2,8] . These algorithms \nare typically very simple to understand and easy to implement, whic h requires little efforts for new users to learn. \nTherefore, researchers with diverse background s can relatively easily use them in their own research. At the same, \nnature -inspired are quite flexible ; that is, these seemingly simple algorithms can solve hi ghly complex, high \nnonlinear optimization problems. In addition, nature -inspired metaheuristic algorithms can often find the global \noptimum solution within a relatively small, finite number of iterations. Some algorithms such as simulated annealing \nand cuc koo search can have guaranteed global convergence. That means that they can find the true global solution \nwith a practically acceptable time scale.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3506, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88d75416-4ec4-497b-8a8a-e4230d759b65": {"__data__": {"id_": "88d75416-4ec4-497b-8a8a-e4230d759b65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "1404_0708v1.pdf", "Title of this paper": "Computational Optimization, Modelling and Simulation: Recent Trends and Challenges", "Authors": "Xin-She Yang, Slawomir Koziel, Leifur Leifsson", "Date published": "04/02/2014", "URL": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0708v1", "summary": "Modelling, simulation and optimization form an integrated part of modern\ndesign practice in engineering and industry.

Further research can focus on the better approaches to achieve \ncomputationally cheap, high -accura cy models.   \nDespite rapid development and practical success of the new optimization methods,  there are significant gaps \nbetween the theory and practice. In practice, many nature -inspired algorithm behave very well and they are  usually \nefficient; however, t here lack s theoretical understanding why these algorithm work well. In fact, apart from a few \nalgorithms such as genetic algorithms with limited results on convergence, there is no mathematical proof for most \nalgorithms why they converge and under what con ditions. Therefore, there is a strong need for further research on \nthe theoretical analysis of metaheuristic algorithms.  This is also true for surrogate -based techniques, and the \nmathematical proof of convergence  for certain specific methods and algorithms  is yet to be seen.  \nAnother significant gap is between large -scale and small -scale problems. In the current literature, most case \nstudies and applications of nature -inspired algorithms are about small -scale to moderate scale problems with a dozen \nor at mos t a few hundred design variables. However, in real -world applications, problems are typically large -scale \nwith thousands or even millions of design variables. It is not yet clear if the same methodology that works for small -\nscale problems can be extended t o solve large -scale problems. One problem is the time constraint. Most problems \ncannot scale up linearly;  consequently large -scale problems can be very computationally extensive. Further research \ncan focus more efforts on large -scale , real-world problems.   \n3. Issues with Modelling  and Simulation  \nTraditional mode lling placed emphasis on mathematical modeling with most models based on partial differential \nequations.  As the vast majority of mathematical models are not solvable analytically, approximate method s and \nnumerical methods are the alternative. Unless the solution behaves smoothly, it may be intractable even with \napproximate methods. In this case, the only feasible approach  is numerical  solution . However, even  though  we can \nin principle solve a complex  system numerically;  this does not mean it is trivial in practice. In fact, most research \nefforts in the last few decades have dedicated to finding the most efficient methods in solving complex systems. As \na result, numerical methods such as finite differe nce method, finite -element method and finite volume method have \nbeen developed  [3]. They usually work very well for linear systems and weakly nonlinear systems.  \nHowever, for highly nonlinear, transient systems such as Navier -Stokes Equations, there is no truly efficient and \naccurate method. In many cases, linearization and approximations are often used, though the valid ity of such models \nis often questionable. In the context of computational optimization, models are often approximated by either using \ncoars e-grid models or surrogate model s.  \nThere are many approximate methods such as perturbation methods, asymptotic methods, kriging, regression, \ntrust-region reconstruction and surrogate -based methods. In recent years, the surrogate -based models have gained \npopularity, and one of the reasons is that it has flexibility to approximate fairly complex systems.
